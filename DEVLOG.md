### 12pm update
- I put the names of the files and what they will eventually contain in the readme and in the doxygen for each file as placeholders.
- time to get started on the first todo for this class. 
## Thursday
### 8 pm Update:
- so I got the first todo done. 
- looks like the second one will also not give me much trouble. 
- ill finish of the third todo for the day as well, this gives me breathing room to work on this project in class and not have to worry about it beyond class.
- got the first one working. now I'm gonna work on other stuff now.
- dla sim file keeps giving me errors. maybe i need to rewrite the whole thing from scratch.
