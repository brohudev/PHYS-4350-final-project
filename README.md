# Final project for Computational Physics (PHYS 4350)

the project aims to replicate the results of the reasearch paper as a final grade in this class...

## task:

1. replicate the images given in the textbook extract.
2. execute one fo the more interesting and complex exercises of the section as proof of concept

## what each file represents:
Since this is a textbook section, I am looking to replicate the results shown in the picture (not exactly since this is a random walk section, but logically).
therefore, the files are named after the pictures they try to mimic, and one exercise to show my grasp of the content in this section(I did two because why not):
- edenClusterSim.py: simulates figure 7.17 (in the text)
- DLAclusterSim.py: simulates figure 7.18
- fractalDimensionalityDLA.py: simulate the DLA cluster fractal dimensionality plot in figure 7.19
- fractalDimensionalityEden.py: simulates the eden cluster fractal dimensionality plot in figure 7.19
- exercise7-19.py: implements exercise 7.19 in the section
- the pictures are for teh respective exercises, kept as proof of the pudding for this project.
